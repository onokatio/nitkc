Experiments on Diffiraction of Light

# Describe diffraction and interface of light

The phenomenon in which a new waveform is formed by superposition of multiple waves is called interference phenomenon

Interference phenomena are prominently observed when waves from the same wave source are superimposed.

Thus, the properties that are mutually correlated and highly coherent are called coherent

Waves generated from different sources do not interfere with each other because they have low coherence.

# Describe briefly the experimental setup and procedures used to obtain the wavelength of a given source of light

The outline figure of this experiment is shown.
A plane wave from a laser light source is made incident on a single slit of width d, and the intensity of the diffracted wave at the slit rear screen is observed.

However, the slit shall be long enough in the height direction.

The principle of interference with a single slit is shown.
In a single slit, it is assumed that an infinite number of slits are arranged between the slits, and interference occurs due to the diffraction of an infinite number of source waves passing therethrough.

The light passing through the slit interferes and is divided into bright and dark lines according to the constructive and destructive parts.

Among the bright lines, the brightest one is called zero-order diffracted light (zero-order bright line), and the bright lines appearing on both sides thereof are called first-order diffracted light (first bright line).

Also, a dark line between the zeroth order diffracted light and the first order diffracted light is called a first order dark line.

# Explain the possible sources of errors for the differences in actual and experimentally obtained wavelength

I think that an error occurred at that time because humans measured it.

In addition, since light is coming from the outside, it is thought that light of different wavelengths may be mixed along the way and errors in the wavelength may finally occur.

If you want to reduce the error more, or if you prove the hypothesis for your own error, I think it is necessary to measure using an electronic measure etc. in a dark room where the light does not penetrate completely.

Also, it seems that the problem is that the experimental environment and equipment were not perfect and the side effects were too great.
